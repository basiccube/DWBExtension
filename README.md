# basiccube's Default Weapon Base Extension

A work-in-progress and unfinished extension of Garry's Mod's weapon base.

Originally created so that I don't have to fix one bug in generic shooty weapon #9431 and then fix that exact same bug in generic shooty weapon #9432 and so on.

Due to this code being 2 years old by now, it's awful and also probably buggy in some way, though I do want to try and update this to be better. Feel free to do anything with it if you really want to.
