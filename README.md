# basiccube's Default Weapon Base Extension

A work-in-progress and unfinished extension of Garry's Mod's weapon base.

Originally created so that I don't have to fix one bug in generic shooty weapon #9431 and then fix that exact same bug in generic shooty weapon #9432 and so on.

Due to this code being 2 years old by now, it's awful and also probably buggy in some way, though I'm working on updating this addon to be much better, so a lot of it will probably be reworked. Feel free to do anything with it if you really want to.
